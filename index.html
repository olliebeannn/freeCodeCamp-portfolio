        <h2>Aboot</h2>

        <p>If you haven't heard enough about me, here's more: I got into design mostly because I wanted to have something to cool to say when people asked me what I do, but also because I care about building things that make people healthier, happier, smarter and more engaged with the world around them.</p>

        <p>I grew up in London (with a few stints in Shanghai) and moved to California in 2009 to go to Stanford where I studied a mix of design, computer science, and art, with a few detours through French, political science, and creative writing.</p>

        <p>Here's my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_Xdv4TFNEyhS0JtdXlNVnprUGM/view">resume</a>, if that's of interest</p>
